The Mobile Station (MS) represents the terminal equipment used by the wireless subscriber supported by the GSM Wireless system. The MS consists of two entities, each with its own identity:

 Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)
 Mobile equipment

The SIM may be a removable module. A subscriber with an appropriate SIM can access the system using various mobile equipments. The equipment identity is not linked to a particular subscriber. Validity checks made on the MS equipment are performed independently of the authentication checks made on the MS subscriber information.

Functions of a SIM:

The functions of the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) are:
 Authentication of the validity of the MS when accessing the network
 User authentication
 Storage of subscriber-related information, which can be: data fixed during administrative phase (e.g., subscriber identification), and temporary network data (e.g., cell location identity).

Functions of a Mobile Station:

The Mobile Station (MS) performs the following:
 Radio transmission termination
 Radio channel management
 Speech encoding/decoding
 Radio link error protection
 Flow control of data
 Rate adaptation of user data to the radio link
 Mobility management
 Performance measurements of radio link


Types of Mobile Stations:

Mobile stations can come in different power classes, which define the maximum
RF power level that the unit can transmit. For GSM-900 there is five powers classes, for GSM-1800 there are three power classes. The mobile station maximum output power is specified in GSM.

CLASS		Max Power (Watts)
				GSM-900			GSM-1800
 I				-							1
 II				8					  0.25
 III			5							4
 IV				2							-
 V			 0.8						-
