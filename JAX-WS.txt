Sun's initial implementation of web services was called JAX-RPC 1.1 (JSR 101). 
This was a standards-based implementation, 
but the binding and parsing layers underneath it were proprietary. 
Additionally, JAX-RPC 1.1 does not completely cover schema specification.

JAX-RPC 1.1 (JSR 101 [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=101])


Sun's newer version of the web services stack, JAX-WS 2.0 (JSR 224), is completely standards based. 
Even the binding layer, the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB, JSR 222), 
and the parsing layer, the Streaming API for XML (StAX, JSR 173) are standards based 
and also support schema specification 100 percent.


As the performance of JAXB and StAX improves, so does the performance of the JAX-WS stack.
