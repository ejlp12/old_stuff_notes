Find and remove duplicate rows from a table

One of the most important features of Oracle is the ability to detect and remove
duplicate rows from a table. While many Oracle DBA place primary key referential
integrity constraints on a table, many shops do not use RI because they need the
flexibility.

The most effective  way to detect  duplicate rows is  to join the  table against
itself as shown below.

SELECT
   BOOK_UNIQUE_ID,
   PAGE_SEQ_NBR,
   IMAGE_KEY
FROM
   page_image A
WHERE
   rowid >
     (SELECT min(rowid) FROM page_image B
      WHERE
         B.key1 = A.key1
      and
         B.key2 = A.key2
      and
         B.key3 = A.key3
      );

Please  note that  you must  specify all  of the  columns that  make the  row a
duplicate in the SQL  where clause. Once you  have detected the duplicate  rows,
you may modify the SQL statement to remove the duplicates as shown below:

DELETE FROM
   table_name A WHERE
   A.rowid >
   ANY (SELECT B.rowid FROM
      table_name B WHERE
      A.col1 = B.col1 AND
      A.col2 = B.col2 ) ;

You can also detect and delete duplicate rows using Oracle analytic functions:

delete from
   customer
where rowid in
 (select rowid from
   (select
     rowid,
     row_number()
    over
     (partition by custnbr order by custnbr) dup
    from customer)
  where dup > 1);

As we  see, there  are several  ways to  detect and  delete duplicate  rows from
Oracle tables.
