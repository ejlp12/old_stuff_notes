3 jalur (bus)

- Data bus
- Address bus
- Cotrol bus 
  kebanyakan sistem paling tidak memiliki 4 jalur kontrol
    MRDC (Memory read control), 
    MWRC (Memory write control), 
    IORC (I/O read control), 
    IOWC (I/O Write control)

Standar bus
ISA (Industry Standard Architecture): 8 MHz, 8-bit (8086/8088) 16-bit (80286-Pentium)
EISA: 8 MHz, 32-bit (older 386 and 486 machines).
PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect): 33 MHz, 32-bit or 64-bit (Pentiums)
VESA (Video Electronic Standards Association): Runs at processor speed. 32-bit or 64-bit (Pentiums)
     Only disk and video. Competes with the PCI but is not popular.
USB (Universal Serial Bus): 10 Mbps (extensions to 100Mbps)
                            Newest systems.
                            Serial connection to microprocessor.
                            For keyboards, the mouse, modems and sound cards.
                            To reduce system cost through fewer wires.
AGP (Advanced Graphics Port): 66MHz
                              Newest systems.
                              Fast parallel connection: Across 64-bits for 533MB/sec.
                              For video cards.
                              To accommodate the new DVD (Digital Versatile Disk) players.
