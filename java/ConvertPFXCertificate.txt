# I exported our Verisign certificate using the instructions that theyh provided us with.

1. Click on the 'Start' Button and then select 'Run'.

2. Type in 'MMC.EXE' and click 'OK'

3. Click the 'Console' menu and then click 'Add/Remove Snap-in'.

4. Click the 'Add' button and then choose the 'certificates' snap-in and click on 'Add'.

5. Select 'Computer Account' then click 'Next'.

6. Select 'Local Computer' and then click 'OK'.

7. Click 'Close' and then click 'OK'.

8. Expand the menu for 'Certificates' and click on the 'Personal' folder.

9. Right click on the certificate that you want to export and select 'All tasks' -> 'Export'.

10. A wizard will appear. Make sure you check the box to include the private key and continue through with this wizard until you have a .PFX file.

# Using the following lines I imported the certificate and key (.pfx file) into the new Apache box.

# Export the private key file from the pfx file
openssl pkcs12 -in filename.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem
# Export the certificate file from the pfx file
openssl pkcs12 -in filename.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem
# This removes the passphrase from the private key Apache on Windows won't
# prompt you for your passphase so you must remove it
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out server.key

I then reference the cert.pem and the server.key in my Apache SSLCertificateKeyFile and SSLCertificateFile directives respectively.
