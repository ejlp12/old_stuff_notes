
Non-delivery report 

Spammers can avoid email filters built into many systems by taking advantage of a mail systems sending of a non-delivery report (NDR).  An NDR is generated when a message cannot be delivered as addressed and returns the original contents.  

CMS calls this a "Reverse NDR attack" (RNDR). Many sites experience this, some so badly that over 99% of their email is attributed to RNDR spam.

The result is the spammer has attained a form of mail relaying with your server's resources being stolen to deliver spam.
