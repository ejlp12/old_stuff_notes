Handover

1. CN Aspect
Intra MSC Handover: Antar RNS (Radio Network Subsystem) masih dalam satu MSC
Inter MSC Handover: Antar RNS berbeda MSC
Intra MSC Handover on MSC B:
SUbsequent MSC Handover: Antar RNC berbeda MSC dengan melewati MSC lain
Subsequest Handback: 

Soft handover
- Antar BS masih dalam satu RNC
- Antar BS berbeda RNC
Softer handover
- Dalam saru BS berbeda cell
Hard handover
- forward hard handover: GMS -> UMTS
- backward hard handover: UMTS -> GSM


SRNC (Serving RNC): the RNC that controls the connections to the core network domains, in other words, it is the RNC that has the Iu connection. 
DRNC (Drift RNC): The RNC that acts as a switch, routing information between the SRNC and the UE. In other words, it is the RNC that has the Iub connection.
Active Set: The set of cells, whose signals are used during a soft handover.
